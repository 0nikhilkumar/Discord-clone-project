1. The goal is to create a clone of Discord. It gives an opportunity for beginners to start their journey with open source. 

2. There are various issues listed. You can also contribute as per your skills. 

3. The homepage is referred to as index.html (very obvious). 

4. You can add your contributions with an appropriate name and remember to comment to make your code easier to read. 

5. Avoid duplicating someone else's work. 

## Thank You!!!
